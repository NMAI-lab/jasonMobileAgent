# jasonMobileAgent

This project demonstrates the use of a BDI agent for navigating through a basic grid environment. There are three versions of the agent, one which navigates using pure AgentSpeak, one which uses an internal action and another which uses an environment based support function.

This project requires Jason to run: https://github.com/jason-lang and http://jason.sourceforge.net/.

A paper explaining this in more detail is being submitted to EMAS 2021.
